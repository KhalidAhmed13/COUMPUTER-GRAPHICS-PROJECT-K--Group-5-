PROJECT PROPOSAL

Metro Rail and Daily Life

1.	Tittle
Visual Simulation of Metro Rail Bridge Scenery with Natural Environment Using Computer Graphics

2.	Introduction
The Metro Rail system plays a vital role in modern urban transportation by reducing traffic congestion and improving daily commuting efficiency. This project focuses on developing a computer graphics–based simulation that visually represents a metro train moving across a bridge over a river. The environment features natural elements, including a rising sun, moving clouds, a floating boat, and trees on both sides of the river, to create a realistic daily life scenario. The simulation highlights the harmony between urban infrastructure and nature.

3.	Problem Statement
As urban areas expand, transportation systems must operate efficiently while maintaining environmental balance. Although metro rail systems provide fast and reliable transportation, their interaction with natural surroundings is often overlooked. There is a lack of visual simulations that show metro rail movement on bridges along with rivers, trees, and environmental activities. This project aims to address this gap by creating a clear and simple graphical representation of such a real-life scenario.

4.	Objectives
•	To create an animated simulation of a metro rail system using computer graphics.
•	To show a metro train moving on a bridge over a river.
•	To include environmental elements such as trees along the riverbanks and near the bridge.
•	To animate natural features like a rising sun, moving clouds, and a floating boat.
•	To demonstrate how metro rail improves daily life while coexisting with nature.
 
5.	Methodology
Software / Tools:
C++ with OpenGL
Design Steps :
•	Design basic objects: metro train, bridge, river, trees, sun, clouds, and boat.
•	Apply translation to animate the metro train crossing the bridge.
•	Animate clouds moving one by one across the sky.
•	Implement boat movement to simulate floating on the river.
•	Add trees on both sides of the river and near the bridge for environmental realism.
•	Integrate the sun rising animation to represent morning time.
•	Combine all elements into a single bridge scenery scene.

10.	Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of computer graphics in simulating real-life urban transportation systems. By combining metro rail movement with natural elements such as rivers, trees, sunlight, and clouds, the simulation presents a balanced view of modern infrastructure and the environment. The project helps viewers understand how metro rail systems contribute to a more efficient and organized daily life.
